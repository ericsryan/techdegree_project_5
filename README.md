Techdegree Project 5-Build a Personal Learning Journal with Flask
_________________________________________________________________

Introduction

This program was developed to implement skills that were learned for using Flask to use Python on the internet. This program will allow users to create learning journal entries that hold title, date, things learned and learning resources. The user will then be able to tag their entries to make searching them easier.


Installation

Once the techdegree_project_5 folder has been downloaded the program can be run from app.py. Project dependancies can be found in requirements.txt.


Using the Program

The user can log in with the username 'test_user' and the password 'password'. The user can add journal entries, delete or edit existing entries, add tags to their entries, and view all entries or search for entries with a specific tag. The journal entries can also be accessed by typing in a user-friendly URL that has an easily readable reference to the entry title.
